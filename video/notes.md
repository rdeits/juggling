16 frames, periodic, each ball in its own y-plane, 0.5 speed, 90 seconds to solve to first feasible solution (not optimal):

Updated the trajectories to cubic instead of quadratic. This was necessary to let the hands move between the planes for the various balls.
16 frames, periodic, each ball in its own plane, 1x speed, took an early solution at 11s.
